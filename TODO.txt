/******* SCANNER STUFF *******/
/*****************************/

- Add a microsyntax. For example, BR = NEWLINE, then edit the block syntanx for it.

- Implement array functionality. For instance:
     array of numbers : Num[]
     array of strings : Str[]
     array of objects: ring[]

- Add rings to scanner and scanner test


- Add the missing regexp to the microsyntax, old were wrong  // So far, StrLit has been modified, 
//still we need to fix a scanner condition for it.

/*****************************/
/******* PARSER STUFF ********/
/*****************************/


- Implement entities to match with the parser

- Implement parser Expressions to match with GollumScript grammar

- Implement 'EOF' so that match('EOF') passes thest in parser

- Finish working on all remaining entitites

- Finish parser and parser unit test
      
      Do the following:
      
      > Run mocha to figure out where the test-syntax-errors.js is not working

      > Modify parser, entities, and .gs programs so they pass all the tests

      > During this process we might need to modify some stuff from the syntax, so
        make proper changes to keep consistency
